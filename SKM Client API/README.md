Serialkeymanager C++ Client API
===============================

This repository contains the official C++ API for interacting with the Serialkeymanager.com
web API.

The C++ API currently supports a subset of the methods available via the web API, more
precisely, activation and deactivation of license keys are currently supported.
The C++ library is currently under development, if you have any other needs, dont hesitate
to contact us.

Example usage
=============

The library is built to be flexible in the way the communication with the serialkeymanager.com
web API is performed. The examples below instantiate a handle class which is responsible
for making the HTTPS requests. This handle is parameterized by several policy classes which
can be used to customize how, among other things, communication is performed. In case this
is too heavy weight it is also possible to sidestep this entierly and manually make the HTTPS
request and simply provide the response as a string, this is illustrated in the section
''Manual HTTPS requests''.

Basic usage:

    SKM skm_handle;
    skm::Error e;
    skm_handle.signature_verifier.set_modulus_base64("ABCDEFGHI1234");
    skm_handle.signature_verifier.set_exponent_base64("ABCD");
    optional<RawLicenseKey> raw_license_key = skm_handle.activate(e, "AAAA-BBBB-...", ...);
    optional<LicenseKey> license_key= skm::LicenseKey::make(e, raw_license_key);
    if (e) { handle_error(e); }

    if (license_key->check()->has_expired(1234567)) {
      std::cout << "Your subscription has expired." << std::endl;
      return;
    }

    if (license_key->check()-has_feature(1)) { std::cout << "Hello, Mr President!" << std::endl; }
    else                                     { std::cout << "Welcome!" << std::endl; }

As can be seen above two types are used to represent license keys, the RawLicenseKey and
LicenseKey. All queries regarding properties of a license key need to be performed on the
LicenseKey object. The purpuse of the RawLicenseKey class is to enable offline activation,
where a previous activation can be saved to disk and then later loaded to check the
validity of a license key without needing to make any HTTP requests. This is enabled by the
RawLicenseKey containing a cryptographic signature, which is checked during the construction
of the RawLicenseKey.

Offline activation example:

    SKM skm_handle;
    skm::Error e;
    optional<RawLicenseKey> raw_license_key = skm_handle.activate(e, "AAAA-BBBB-...", ...);
    if (e) { handle_error(e); }
    file << raw_license_key->get_license() << "-" << raw_license_key->get_signature() << std::endl;

and then when offline the activation can be verified via:

    skm::Error e;
    std::string s << file;
    std::string license = ...
    std::string signature = ...
    optional<RawLicenseKey> raw_license_key = skm::RawLicenseKey::make(e, license, signature);
    if (e) { handle_error(e); }

Error handling
==============

The library uses an exceptionless design and return values use optionals where they can be missing.
All functions that can fail also accept as the first argument an instance of skm::Error which
is used for reporting more detailed error information.

Furthermore, an additional design decision is used to with regards to error handling. If an
error occurs, the following functions that take the same error object are turned into noops.
Consider the following code:

    skm::Error e;
    f1(e);
    f2(e);

If an error occurs during the call to f1(), f2() will not be performed. This allows writing
several function calls after each other without having to check for errors after
every single call.

Handle class
============

The SKM class above is really an alias for the basic_SKM class, which takes two type parameters
represnting a class for dealing with HTTP requests and one for checking cryptographic signatures.
Currently one version of each is provided, the RequestHandler_curl class for making HTTPS requests
built on top of the Curl library and the SignatureVerifier_OpenSSL for checking cryptographic
signatures built on top of the OpenSSL/LibreSSL libraries.

    using SKM = basic_SKM<RequestHandler_curl, SignatureVerifier_OpenSSL>;

Manual HTTPS requests
=====================

In some cases it may be an unneccessary amount of work to implement a RequestHandler, in
particular it may depend on what part of the code is responsible for initating the call.
For this reason we also provide a method that parses a string containing the response
from the web API and returns the corresponding license key object:

    skm::Error e;
    optional<LicenseKey> key = skm::handle_activate(e, web_api_resonse);
    // rest is the same
